					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>This developer documentation is provided to help developers of the WMG website integrate the blocks system into the existing website.</p>
					<h2>Sitebuilder</h2>
					<p>The WMG website is built with Sitebuilder, though this documentation is not a guide on how to utilise the Sitebuilder system. We have very limited access to control how Sitebuilder functions, and no access to the server, databases or backend code. For guides on how to use sitebuilder and its API feeds, you should visit the Sitebuilder FAQ.</p>
					<p>We utilise several features of Sitebuilder in order to populate the blocks we used on the website. These include Data Content Pages, Event Calendars and News Feeds. We are able to grab this data using the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/web/sitebuilder2/faqs/api/feeds/" target="_blank">Sitebuilder JSON data feeds (APIs)</a> available to us.</p>
					<p>These feeds return a JSON file of post data that is processed within each block to populate the content.</p>
					<h2>GIT</h2>
					<p>The project uses GIT version control using a <a href="https://github.com/wmgweb/wmg-2022" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>. To gain access to this repo, please email <a href="mailto:wmgwebsupport@warwick.ac.uk?subject=WMG%20Website%20Github%20Repo%20Access" target="_blank">wmgwebsupport@warwick.ac.uk</a></p>
					<p>All development should be done in a sub-branch of the 'dev' branch. You can either create your own permenant branch for your work, or create branches on a job-by-job basis. Once tested and ready for deployment, it should be pulled into the 'dev' branch, then finally the 'master' branch.</p>
					<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
					<h3>Tools</h3>
					<p>The website utilises three tools to install and compile all code:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Node.js</strong> - a JavaScript runtime which we use to run toolkits like Gulp.</li>
						<li><strong>Gulp 4</strong> - a toolkit designed to automate and enhance workflow. It is used in this project to compile all Handlebars, SASS and JavaScript development files into distribution files that are imported into the website.</li>
						<li><strong>NPM</strong> - a software registry where we download packages used by Gulp to compile our code, or packages required by the site such as Slick Carousel. NPM packages can be found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and added/edited/removed in the package.json file. You can find a guide on how to use package.json <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json" target="_blank">here</a>. It is important that we set exact package version numbers so we don't encounter version issues moving forward. Once installed, these packages appear in the node_modules folder.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Setup</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Clone the GIT repo.</li>
						<li>Install Node.js from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
						<li>Open up the command line and navigate to the project folder.</li>
						<li>Install packages using the following command: <code>npm install</code>.</li>
						<li>Install Gulp using the following command: <code>npm install --global gulp-cli</code>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Your project is now ready for development. You will not need to repeat the above steps unless you create a new development environment in the future.</p>
					<h3>Developing</h3>
					<p>All development is done inside of the #dev folder. Files inside dist should not be touched.</p>
					<p>To initalise development, run the following command: <code>gulp watch</code>. This command will look for changes to files in the #dev folder and compile them into the .css and .js files in the dist folder.</p>
					<p>You can build the dist files without requiring the Gulp to look for changes by running <code>gulp build</code>. This is useful if you have made a quick change and just need to build new files.</p>
					<h3>Adding Dependencies</h3>
					<p>Ocassionally you may want to add new dependencies to the project, for example a JavaScript library. You do this through the following steps:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Locate the package in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a>. Grab the package string.</li>
						<li>Add the package to 'dependencies' in package.json.</li>
						<li>Create a new line in the dependencies function in gulpfile.js above <code>done()</code>, and add the following, changing the source and destination path as required: <pre>gulp.src(['node_modules/masonry-layout/dist/masonry.pkgd.js']).pipe(gulp.dest(config.devJS + '/vendor/'));</pre></li>
						<li>Run <code>gulp dep</code> to install the new packages, then <code>gulp build</code> to compile them into the dist code.
					</ul>
					<p>It should be noted that any dependencies added in this way will also add weight to the project files loaded into each page. If you are adding a feature specifically for a single page, you might consider uploading the file to Sitebuilder and including it in the page head instead.</p>
					<h2>load-resources.js</h2>
					<p>The load-resources.js file found at <code>#dev/js/load-resources.js</code> is the file that the website will fetch in order to load the additional .js and .css files to run the block code.</p>
					<p>Currently the file loads in the main.js and main.css files which are required.</p>
					<p>You can add additional files in here by adding the files to the relevant JS or CSS array.</p>
					<p>While viewing the website, this file also allows you to bypass caching by adding the url parameter <code>?cache=0</code> to the end of the url string.</p>
					<h2>Block Development</h2>
					<h3>Block Creation</h3>
					<p>To create a new block, you need to add the following line of code to the page content HTML.</p>
					<pre>&lt;div class="wmg-block" data-block_id="HB01" data-content_url="HB01"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
					<p>There are a set of parameters you can add to each block to determine settings such as which block to output, the content url, filtering options and styling options. A full set of parameters can be found <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/intranet/info/comms/wmg-website-support/developers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<h3>Block Content</h3>
					<p>Blocks are populated with content using 2 methods - the <code>data-content_url</code> and <code>data-posts_url</code>. The former option is utilised on every block and is used to populate static content. The latter is used on set blocks to output news feed data. A full set of 
					<h3>block-output.js</h3>
					<p>This file, found in <code>#dev/js/block-output.js</code> outputs all the blocks onto the page, and contains important functions to process shortcodes, call APIs, create edit buttons and much more.</p>
					<h3>Block HTML (Handlebars markup)</h3>
					<p>All individual block HTML is located in the .hbs files in <code>#dev/blocks</code>.</p>
					<p>Each block contains a unique ID which is set on page-load using <code>id="block-{{ blockCount }}"</code>.
					<p>Each block must have a wrapper element <code>&lt;div class="block__content"&gt;</code>. This wrapper allows the block to perform certain functions such as finding shortcodes.</p> 
					<h3>Block Javascript</h3>
					<p>All block JavaScript is added in script element at the bottom of the .hbs file. The top of this script element must contain the <code>blockFunctions('{{ blockCount }}');</code> function. This function runs important block tasks such as adding edit buttons and processing shortcodes.</p>
					<p>You also add block specific JavaScript here, such as Slick Carousel, or AJAX calls.</p>
					<h3>Block CSS</h3>
					<p>Block CSS is located in the SASS files at <code>#dev/scss/blocks/</code>. For each block you create, if it requires bespoke CSS you should also create a SASS file in this folder with the block ID as it's name, e.g. <code>AC01.scss</code>. There are also block family SASS files for situations where block CSS may need to be shared between a family of blocks, e.g. <code>AC.scss</code>.</p>
					<p>Each Block SASS file can utilise any of the mixins or variables declared and exained in the Global CSS section.</p>
					<h2>Global CSS</h2>
					<h3>Variables</h3>
					<p>Global SASS variables can be found in <code>#dev/sass/_variables.scss</code>. These include colours, fonts, image paths, container sizes and screen breakpoints. Changing any variables in here will change them on a global scale.</p>
					<h3>Mixins</h3>
					<p>Global SASS mixins can be found in <code>#dev/sass/_mixins.scss</code>. These include functions to output block themes, breakpoints, spacing, margin and borders. These should only be touched by an experienced developer.</p>
					<h3>Core</h3>
					<p>The core SASS can be found in <code>#dev/sass/global/core</code>. In here you can find CSS for core elements of the website such as header, footer, spacing, borders, defaults, containers.</p>
					<h3>Elements</h3>
					<p>The element SASS can be found in <code>#dev/sass/global/elements</code>. In here you can find CSS for elements used throughout the website and blocks brand triangles, inner blocks, panels, posts and lists.</p>
					<h3>Header/Footer</h3>
					<p>The header/footer CSS is located in 2 files - <code>#dev/sass/global/header.scss</code> and <code>#dev/sass/global/footer.scss</code>. This code compiles into a separate CSS file (<code>dist/on-load.css</code>) as well as the global main.css file.</p>
					<p>When any updates are made to the header/footer CSS, the <code>on-load.css</code> file contents should be copied to the <code>wmg-site.less</code> file found in the root of Sitebuilder. This is to ensure that all header/footer changes are loaded on page load, otherwise it may cause some jumping around or style changes after all the files have loaded.</p>
